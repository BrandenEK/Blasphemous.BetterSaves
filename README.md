## Features
- Increases the amount of usable save slots (Default 12)
- Allows you to name each save file

## Notes
- Use the shoulder buttons to switch between screens on the slots menu
- Total number of slots can be adjusted in the config file
- Savegame 8 and 9 might be used for internal data, so maybe don't mess with them
- Currently you can set the name through the 'slots' command, soon there will be a menu as well
